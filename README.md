# Image-Reconstruction-with-Autoencoders

Welcome to the Image Reconstruction with Autoencoders project in Python! This repository serves as an introduction to autoencoders, a class of neural networks used for unsupervised learning and particularly powerful in image reconstruction tasks.

Autoencoders are neural network architectures designed for data encoding and decoding. In the context of images, an autoencoder learns a compressed representation of the input data, which can then be decoded to reconstruct the original image. This unsupervised learning approach is particularly useful for tasks like image denoising, dimensionality reduction, and data compression.
